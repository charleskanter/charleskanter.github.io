### AutoML: [Neural Architecture Search for Sequence Models](/pdf/NAS_poster.pdf)

In this research project, we leverage reinforcement learning techniques to automate the selection of neural network architectures for financial time series forecasting. We train an agent to explore different network architectures, update its policy with Q-learning methods, and ultimately exploit its knowledge to suggest an optimal architecture.

### [Prediction Engine for Quarterly Reporting Metrics](/pdf/wellington_poster.pdf)

We explore the use of alternative data and ML models to predict company earning metrics. We apply preprocessing techniques, including upsampling and moving average filtering, and evaluate various models such as decision tree regression, Ridge regression, XGBoost, and RNN, with Ridge regression showing the best performance.

### Fraud Detection

In this project, I collaborated with a team to build a fraud prediction model using credit card transaction data. We engineered features for linear and logistic regression, tested different feature set, and determined best performer using ROC-AUC.
